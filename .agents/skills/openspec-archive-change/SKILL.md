# Archive an OpenSpec change

Use this skill only when implementation is complete and the user asks to finalize a change.

1. Resolve the active change with `./taskctl openspec cli list --json` and its linked portfolio task with `./taskctl list --json`.
2. Run `./taskctl verify <task-id> --archive-ready`. Stop on open mdtask steps, invalid OpenSpec artifacts, missing exact-SHA evidence, or any `required`/`blocked` evidence category.
3. Require portfolio status `review`; never treat an agent checkbox as acceptance.
4. Run `./taskctl openspec archive <change-name>`. Never call the upstream archive command directly, pass `--no-validate`, move a change directory manually, or proceed after a warning.
5. Run `./taskctl close prepare <task-id> --outcome done --evidence "<concise evidence summary>"`.
6. Stop and ask for the terminal-state commit. `close purge` is a later, separately committed step.

For a dropped task, do not archive incomplete behavior deltas as completed. Prepare `dropped` with an explicit reason and preserve the active change until the owner decides whether to revise or remove it.
