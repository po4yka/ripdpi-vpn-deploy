## Gates

- Local: staged per-consumer molecule runs, `make ci-fast`, `make validate`.
- Remote CI: green run on the merge SHA.
- Dry-run: full-inventory `make dry-run` post-consolidation.
- Live: one node re-converged end to end with rendered-config snapshot parity where behavior is intended unchanged.
- Artifact: consolidated runtime path pinned by its own contract tests in CI artifacts.
