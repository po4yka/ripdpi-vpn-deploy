# Verification

## Requirement evidence

| Requirement | Execution step | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-DEPLOY-CLEAN-GUARANTEE | VPD-1787497373487307 | Failure-injection test asserts cleanup executed and original error surfaced | passed |
| REQ-RECONVERGE-LIMIT-VALIDATION | VPD-1787497373490128 | Rejection-table unit tests over pattern and malformed ipv4 values | passed |
| REQ-HOST-FLAG-RESOLUTION | VPD-1787497373493403 | Tests assert registry resolution and unknown-alias failure for doctor and probe | passed |
| REQ-SUMMARY-SECRETS-PATHS | VPD-1787497373493403 | Snapshot of the plan summary shows placeholders only | passed |

### Final checks on the reviewed implementation

- `build-gate -- make -j1 check` passed under restrictive umask 077: Python 1024 passed, 1 existing unconditional live-scanner placeholder skipped; BATS 55 passed; Rust release 173 passed; Terraform mocks 79 passed; 102 snapshots matched.
- Release clippy, Rust 1.88 locked MSRV, cargo deny, cloud-init schema in Docker, and all render/schema/lint gates passed. `make validate` also passed after the final role edit. Rust debug independently passed 173 tests.
- [Hosted CI run 33069634871](https://github.com/po4yka/ripdpi-vpn-deploy/actions/runs/33069634871) passed on `984b4528b634b4b48fa74fac0b4cbb22b8b7b887`. PR #108 has 62 successful checks and one neutral Trivy SARIF report; both image scan jobs succeeded. Expanded Molecule scenarios executed on hosted amd64 Linux.
- Earlier umask, role runtime, fixture, and container validation failures are superseded by these successful reruns. Local amd64 systemd Molecule on this arm64 Mac remains unavailable (`pidfd_open` ENOSYS); hosted Molecule is the observed role-runtime evidence, not production evidence.
- Existing cargo-deny duplicate-dependency warnings and one workflow line-length warning remain. The skipped live scanner test is not counted as acceptance.

## Remaining acceptance blockers

Implementation and local/hosted regression gates passed. Archive and terminal closure remain blocked by the dry-run, staging (where required), and live categories above. SSH to all three configured production hosts timed out; this Mac requires Tailscale reauthentication. No production deployment ran.

## Proportional verification decision — 2026-09-06

Verification follows the portfolio proportional-evidence policy. Source closure does not claim staging or live operation; any delegated operational requirement remains open in the task named in the front matter evidence above.
